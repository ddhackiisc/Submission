# Common Form [link]
Here we put the single best molecule found 
Its not clear to me whether we are supposed to combine all our problems and submit one such form or use the links below each problem statement 

## PS-2-04
Use multiple SARS-CoV-2 protease conformation to screen of generated chemicals using ensemble molecular docking protocol at both allosteric and orthosteric sites. Retain chemicals with best docking scores and binding energies as per the guidelines. Shortlist the top 100 or top 25% (max 100) hits and refine the best 10 using MD simulation without any restraints.

Assessment Criteria:
SMARTS: The molecules should not have unlikely structures
Tanimoto similarity coefficients: Should not be more than 60% similar to training set
Presumably they will also look at binding energies

Generated chemicals in smiles - what does this mean?

Proposed Functional, technical design documents - guess this means the python scripts and explanation of how it works

Innovation & Differentiation - “Describe how you would enhance. differentiate and add novelty to your approach. This can be in data & feature preparation , modelling, software development, user interfaces or scientific assumptions”
